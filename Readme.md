# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

A Streamlit-based web application that detects whether a news article is **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing and a Machine Learning classifier (PassiveAggressiveClassifier).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Fake news has become a significant issue in the modern digital world. This project aims to classify news articles as either **real** or **fake** using text classification techniques. The solution uses:

- **TF-IDF vectorization** for feature extraction.
- **PassiveAggressiveClassifier** for model training.
- **Streamlit** for deploying the app.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a combination of:

- [`Fake.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- [`True.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)

Each file contains news articles labeled as either fake or real.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Vectorizer**: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Classifier**: Passive Aggressive Classifier (fast, memory-efficient for binary classification)

The model is trained on a balanced dataset and achieves high accuracy on unseen data.
